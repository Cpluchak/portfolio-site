    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>My name is Cody Pluchak. I enjoy spending time with my family, Going to the range, Playing video games. I have
        been working in the private contracting field for the last 7 years. With intentions of becoming a Police
        Officer. I have always had an interest in software though and decided to finally make the career change.</p>
